    <h5>Things to Add:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Video Chat</li>
        <li>Music Playlist - Interactable by both/any user in the current chat session</li>
        <li>Video Playlist - Interactable by both/any user in the current chat session</li>
        <li>Dynamic Map Markers</li>
        <li>Object Detection Alert System (SOON: Motorized auto-brakes to stop for pedestrians/debri)</li>
        <li>Hand Signal Detection & Logic for safety and service workers directing traffic manually with hand signals</li>
        <li>Minimalist Mode - Nothing but emergency related UI events will appear on the windshield, as if there wasn't even a heads-up display installed in your car. Users can add/remove different features as well as adjust the frequency of windshield events/alerts.</li>
        <li>Lost/Explore Mode - Get ALL the data from ALL of the locations in your current location. All a user has to do is narrow down the type of information they're looking for (phone number, hours, etc.). Users can also filter all places by type (food, entertainment, golf courses, bus stations, medical centers, religious centers, etc.)</li>
        <li>Road Trip Mode - Drivers will get an organized piloting view with all future road trip data in view (next turn and when, current traffic, upcoming traffic, current weather, weather forecast, construction zones, overall trip map, milage tracking, current speed, current average speed of nearby vehicles for example: is the entire highway passing you while you're in lala land, we'll let you know. Alternatively, we'll let you know when you're going way too fast compared the current traffic speed and density). The front passenger has full access to WideSpread on the windshield, allowing them to do anything they can do on WideSpread with any other device with a screen(watch shows/movies in Entertainment, go to class at Academy, play an AR game, or use a seperate handheld Spread device that is hooked up to SpreadShield as the games controllers (play multiplayer with rear-seat passengers that have their seperate handheld Spread devices hooked up to the SpreadShield as well), etc.)</li>
        <li>Security Mode - While SpreadShield vehicles are in park (), users have the option to turn on any and all cameras currently connected to their SpreadShield. This feature can be used for security reasons (surveillence system) or for social reasons (invite people to watch/experience you're current activity in 2D or 360deg)</li>
